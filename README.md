⚽ Success Score: A Novel Statistical Parameter for Team Performance Analysis

📌 About This Repository

This repository contains the code, dataset, and machine learning models used in our research paper, where we introduce Success Score, a novel statistical parameter to measure the quality of a football team. The Success Score is calculated as the sum of expected goals (xG) and actual goals scored against their opponents and is scaled to a range of 0 to 10 for easy interpretation.

Our machine learning model is trained using data from four major European leagues over four seasons:

🇪🇸 La Liga
🇩🇪 Bundesliga
🇮🇹 Serie A
🏴 Premier League

Additionally, we tested our model on 2025 season data, including 🇫🇷 Ligue 1.

📊 Data & Features

We used two main datasets, which are available in the data/ folder. The features used in our machine learning model include:
	•	Team Quality & Prestige
	•	Expected Goals (xG) & Actual Goals
	•	Short-term & Long-term Performance Trends
	•	Match Outcomes (Win/Draw/Loss)
	•	Tactical Playstyles (10 main tactics introduced in our paper)
	•	Rolling Averages for Performance Trends

The dataset is preprocessed with feature engineering before being fed into a fully connected neural network.

🛠 Model & Methodology

We trained our model using a fully connected neural network on data from four consecutive seasons (2021-2024). The training process involved:

✔ Data Preprocessing
✔ Feature Engineering (10 Tactical Metrics)
✔ Rolling Averages for Performance Stability
✔ Training with Neural Networks

The trained model predicts the Success Score for a given match and provides valuable insights into team performance evaluation, match outcome prediction, and over/underperformance detection.

🚀 Applications of Success Score

With the Success Score, we introduce several useful applications, including:

🔹 Identifying Overperforming or Underperforming Teams
🔹 Predicting Match Outcomes (Win/Not Win, Lose/Not Lose)
🔹 Evaluating Team Consistency & Tactical Effectiveness

We evaluated our model on unseen 2025 season data across five major leagues, demonstrating its effectiveness in analyzing and predicting match performances.
