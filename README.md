# ‚öΩ Success Score: A Novel Statistical Parameter for Team Performance Analysis

![Project Workflow](IMAGE-2025-02-10-23-39-42.jpg)

## üìå About This Repository
This repository contains the **code, dataset, and machine learning models** used in our research paper, where we introduce **Success Score**, a novel statistical parameter to measure the quality of a football team. The **Success Score** is calculated as the **sum of expected goals (xG) and actual goals scored** against their opponents and is **scaled to a range of 0 to 10** for easy interpretation.

Our machine learning model is trained using data from **four major European leagues** over four seasons:

üá™üá∏ **La Liga**  
üá©üá™ **Bundesliga**  
üáÆüáπ **Serie A**  
üè¥ **Premier League**  

Additionally, we **tested our model** on **2025 season data**, including üá´üá∑ **Ligue 1**.

## üìä Data & Features
We used **two main datasets**, which are available in the `Data/` folder. The features used in our machine learning model include:

- **Team Quality & Prestige**
- **Expected Goals (xG) & Actual Goals**
- **Short-term & Long-term Performance Trends**
- **Match Outcomes (Win/Draw/Loss)**
- **Tactical Playstyles** *(10 main tactics introduced in our paper)*
- **Rolling Averages for Performance Trends**

The dataset is preprocessed with **feature engineering** before being fed into a **fully connected neural network**.

## üõ† Model & Methodology
We trained our model using a **fully connected neural network** on data from **four consecutive seasons (2021-2024)**. The training process involved:

‚úî **Data Preprocessing**  
‚úî **Feature Engineering (10 Tactical Metrics)**  
‚úî **Rolling Averages for Performance Stability**  
‚úî **Training with Neural Networks**  

The trained model **predicts the Success Score** for a given match and provides valuable insights into **team performance evaluation, match outcome prediction, and over/underperformance detection**.

## üöÄ Applications of Success Score
With the **Success Score**, we introduce several useful applications, including:

üîπ **Identifying Overperforming or Underperforming Teams**  
üîπ **Predicting Match Outcomes (Win/Not Win, Lose/Not Lose)**  
üîπ **Evaluating Team Consistency & Tactical Effectiveness**  

We evaluated our model on **unseen 2025 season data** across **five major leagues**, demonstrating its effectiveness in analyzing and predicting match performances.
